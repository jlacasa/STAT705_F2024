# Final project  

Students will engage in a semester-long project. 
Semester projects may deal with any topic that interests the student, as long as it is approved by the instructors. 
Broadly, students are expected to identify a research problem and develop an appropriate statistical model to solve that problem. 
Students are also expected to produce a reproducible statistical analysis and a tutorial (e.g., a pdf of html file describing the code).
