**Course Description:**  This course introduces students to statistical modeling and, more broadly, statistical thinking (more on statistical thinking here and here). 
We will cover linear regression, ANOVA, model checking, and model selection. We may cover more advanced topics like generalized linear (mixed) models, Bayesian regression and missing data techniques.

**Main Goal of this Course:**  
To encourage students to think statistically, considering the data generating process and the different sources of uncertainty.  
At the end of this course, students are expected to know how to apply different basic statistical concepts using R software.  

**What this course is not:**  
- An R programming course.However, help will be provided.
- 

**Prerequisites:** One previous statistics course. Some background R programming is convenient, but not required.
